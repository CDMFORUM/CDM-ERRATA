# CDM-ERRATA

### What is the CDM Errata?
The errata lists the minor errors and typos that have been identified in the PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM) specification, with thanks to the individuals and teams who have pointed them out. It is intended as a guide to data partners, and to assist in evaluation for future CDM updates and releases. 

### Why are there errors?
Despite our best efforts, which include formal review cycles and incorporation of feedback, some errors are not identified during this process. Our goal is to identify and promote awareness of these corrections.

### What is the scope of the errata?
Errata only applies to the current releases of the CDM specification. Any potential CDM expansion, such as evaluation of new domains or data elements, is not covered under the scope of the errata. 

Please note that the Common Data Model specifications are hosted at [http://www.pcornet.org/pcornet-common-data-model/](http://www.pcornet.org/pcornet-common-data-model/)
